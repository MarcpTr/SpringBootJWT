#  Spring Boot Notes API

A RESTful API built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security 6**, **JWT**, and **MySQL** that allows users to register, log in, and securely manage their personal notes. It uses **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to transfer data between application layers.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security 6
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- MySQL
- Maven
- DTOs for data transfer

---

##  Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JWT tokens**, which are generated upon login and required to access protected routes (`/api/**`).

---

##  Endpoints

###  Authentication

| Method | Route            | Description               |

| POST   | `/auth/register` | Register a new user       |
| POST   | `/auth/login`    | Authenticate (log in)     |

> These routes return a JWT token that must be sent in the header when accessing protected routes:
> ```
> Authorization: Bearer <token>
> ```

##  Data Structure (DTOs)

> DTOs are used to receive and send data between the client and server, hiding internal models.

###  Example: `NoteDto`



    {
      "title": "Note title",
      "content": "Note content"
    }

##  Data Structure (Real Model)

> The real model represents the full entity persisted in the database. It contains technical fields (IDs, timestamps, relations) not exposed through the DTO.

###  Example: `Note`

####  Java (Entity)

```java

@Entity
@Getter
@Setter
public class Note {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private String content;
    @CreationTimestamp
    @Column(name="created_at", nullable = false, updatable = false)
    private Timestamp createdAt;
    @Column(name="updated_at")
    @UpdateTimestamp
    private Timestamp updatedAt;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id",  nullable = false)
    @CreatedBy
    private User user;
}
